How to See the Saved Output
The file is located in the directory where you ran the command, which is ~/MerCBO/.

Here are a few useful commands you can use to view the log file (you can run these in a new terminal or after detaching from your screen session):

To view the live output as it happens (most useful):

Bash

tail -f ~/MerCBO/nas_run.log
The -f (follow) flag will continuously display new lines as they are added to the file. Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.

To view the entire file from the beginning (can be long):

Bash

less ~/MerCBO/nas_run.log
This lets you scroll up and down through the entire history of the run. Press q to quit.

To see just the last 100 lines of the log:

Bash

tail -n 100 ~/MerCBO/nas_run.log
To search for specific lines, like each time a new evaluation starts:

Bash

grep "Evaluating Architecture" ~/MerCBO/nas_run.log
You have set up the experiment perfectly for a long-running job. All your results and progress are being securely saved.
